Regression tests for data checksums
===================================
This directory contains a test suite for enabling, and disabling, data
checksums both offline as well as in a running cluster.

Running the tests with autoconf
===============================

    make check

or

    make installcheck

Running the tests with meson
============================
From your build directory, issue the following command:

    meson test -q --print-errorlogs --suite setup --suite test_checksums

NOTE: This creates a temporary installation (in the case of "make check" or
"--suite setup"), with multiple nodes, be they master or standby(s) for the
purpose of the tests.

NOTE: This test suite requires TAP tests to be enabled, a subset of the tests
also require injection points to function.  In order to run the extended test
then "checksum_extended" must be set in the PG_TEST_EXTRA environment
variable.
